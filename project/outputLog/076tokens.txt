the

is
that
the

diminishes
the

of

that

then
the
reduction
in

should
result
in
a
shortening
of
the

well
as
diminishing
risk
due
to
defocusing
of

further
benefit
perceived
by

the
binocular

visual
field
for

eye
and
the

this
binocular
vision
givesthe

a
perception
of

allows

it

thepotential

to

once

requirement
for
a
small

to

the

cannot
be
accomplished
by

because

therefore
an

the
