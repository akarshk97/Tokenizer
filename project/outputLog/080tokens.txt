difference
between
the
airsar
cm
data
and
sirc
mlc
data
is
chiefly
that
for
airsar
the
elements
of
the
stokes
matrix
are
stored
directly
to
each
compressed
byte
while
for
sirc
the
crossproducts
that
when
combined
appropriately
comprise
the
stokes
matrix
are
stored
in
addition
the
airsar
data
employs
a
general
scale
factor
while
sirc
does
not
and
finally
the
value
stored
in
the
first
two
bytes
by
airsar
is
the
total
power
divided
by
the
general
scale
factor
while
the
value
stored
in
the
first
two

by

is
