was
at
an
early
point
in
her
childhood
when
the

at

it
probably
cameas
no

to
those
who
knew
her
that
the
second

andgeorgia
cordell
flung
herself
enthusiastically
into

none
of

halfheartedas
a

i
decided
that
i
needed
to
be
stronger

i
would
carrythese

and
when
i
decided
i
had
to
cure
myself
ofvertigo
which
id
had
since
i
was
seven
i
started
to
climb
the
faces
ofcliffs
near
my
home
no
ropes
no
tools
no
nothing
it
was
terrible
but
ithought
i
needed
to
get
over
my
fear
id
get
to
the
top
and
then
lie
downand
crawl
back
to
the
edge
like
a
snake
and
make
myself
look

made
up
her

she
pitched

making
sure
she
completed
at

a
foot
of
books
per

sheeventually
knew
every
shelf
in

and
became
aware
thatknowledge
was
larger
than

when

on

all
i
do
is
write
shesays
i
can
obsess
about
one
poem
for
weeks
if
i
want
to
often
illwrite
one
humongous
poem

then
the

starts
there
are
hugebaths
of
imagery
thought
context
emotions
that
wash
over
the
originalimages
thoughts
and
ideas
i
started
with
poetry
is
the
kind
of
art
thatneeds
long
spaces
of
time
to
think
and
to
create
and
just
allow
the
fluidmovement
of
images
to
wash
over
the
whole
paradigmatic
axis
of

thewhole
memory
selfthats
what
grants
such
as
from
the
national

for
the

permitartists
to
do
but
now
the
stupid
totalitarian
people
who
are
scared
ofideas
and
who
want
the
world
their
way
have
had
their
way
with
the
nea
andits
basically
gone
she
saysto
write
a
book
of
poetry
takes
usually
five
to
or
years
butintensive
care
was
an
exception
it
took
me
from
to
about
or
when
i
first
started
writing
those
poems
it
was
very
cathartic
the
poemnursing
was
written
when
i
was
in
such
a
rage
i
was
so
angry
the
kindof
anger
where
you
think
you
are
going
to
melt
i
was
angry
at
the
entiremedical
profession
angry
at
nurses
who
couldnt
spell
or
remember
to
covermanons
stomach
with
the
lead
shield
during

manons
first
months
of

none
of
her
bodys
systemswere
working
including
her
ability
to
speak
she
communicated
by
spellingwords
not
vocally
but
by
having
her
mother
or
a
nurse
recite
the
alphabetout
loud
while
she
indicated
by
blinking
letter
by
letter
the
words
shewanted
to

either
could

who
did

the

used
to

out
of

only
body
part
she
could
move
at
that
time
as
a

that
her

was
twisted
and
she
wasin
great
pain
and
long
overdue
for

her
mother
discovered
theproblem
the
next
morning
she
addressed
the
nurses
in
nursing
see
pagethere
were
wonderful
nurses
too
of
course
she
recalls
but
the
poemwas
cathartic
in
dealing
with
those
bad
ones
some
of
the
other
poems
inthe
book
were
ways
of
funneling
unresolved
things
from
my
life
through
thatexperience
that
experience
cast
a
new
light
on
those
unresolved
thingsthe
kind
of
light
that
makes
meaning
in
life
that
kind
of
making
meaningis
what
makes
us
humanmanon
still
weeps
at
her
mothers
public
readings
from
intensive
care
andto
this
day
there
is
still
one
poem
that
getsi
cannot
read
aloud
withoutchoking
a
little
the
book
for
her
is
my
experience
of
her
illness
shesays
it
is
a
mirror
she
can
look
back
into
because
blessedly
she
didnot
see
herself
in
the
mirror
during
that
time
at
the
time
she
looked
asthough
she
would
not
survive
and
i
did
not
let
her
see
thatalthough
she
continues
to
bring
poetry
to
classrooms
in
illinois
andelsewhere
getsi
cant
hide
her
disappointment
in
the
state
of
readingespecially
reading
poetry
these
dayspoetry
just
isnt
there
in
the
schools
she
says
it
isnt
in
publicschools
it
isnt
in
the
libraries
it
isnt
even
much
in
the
bookstoresexcept
for
specialized
bookstores
anything
that
requires
lonelyconcentration
is
not
in
the
schools
anymore
its
not
a
financial
issueits
just
unnatural
to
our
contemporary
culture
to
be
silent
but
poetrygrows
out
of
that
silence
as
a
result
poetry
now
has
been
marginalizedand
hiddenreading
during
childhood
particularly
reading
poetry
can
introducechildren
to
a
new
worlds
of
information
and
insight
and
experience
that
canultimately
inspire
them
to
explore
their
own
ideas
and
feelings
childrengetsi
firmly
believes
need
poetry
and
art
and
music
and
drama
and
all
thearts
in
their
lives
as
early
as
possible
in
order
to
have
the
greatestbenefit
throughout
theirlives
but
the
great
power
of
poetry
is
nowhere
tobe
found
in
too
many
american
schoolsninety
percent
of
the
teachers
in
elementary
and
high
schools
dont
knowwhere
to
go
to
find
poetry
ive
been
to
hundreds
of
school
libraries
wherethey
dont
have
books
in
the
library
only
audiovisual
equipment
orcomputers
most
school
libraries
dont
have
poetry
especially
elementaryschool
libraries
its
because
students
arent
expected
to
go
in
and
readand
if
they
do
go
in
they
dont
read
poetry
because
they
havent
beenexposed
to
it
ive
been
to
some
of
the
best
schools
in
our
state
to
do
apoetry
workshop
and
have
had
students
who
have
never
read
a
poem
theymight
get
a
hallmark
card
with
what
is
called
poetry
on
it
and
thats
whatthey

they
dont

to
know
everything
about
a

itall
they
have
to
do
is
enjoy
it
and
let
students
enjoy
it
just
put
thepoetry
out
therethe
program
is
free
to
the

but
they
have
to
do
it
under

only
thing
i

that

i
want
the

so
deeply
that
they

her
to
quit
bringing

to
the
younger
set
getsi
brims
withhope
and
excitement
when
she
tells
about
the
students
in
the
k
class
shemet
in

the
very
atrisk
teenagers

of
horses
by
german
artist
franz
marc
as
a

forimagery
i
use
franz
marcs
works
because
they
always
have
weird
stuff
inthem
that
cant
be
explained
she
says
i
ask
the
students
to
walk
intothe
picture
and
describe
what
is
happening
i
ask
them
to
describe
shapesand
to
step
in

out

and
to
walk
around
the

the
assignment
is
to

to
and
which
ends
up
many

that
is
a
complete
experience

says
they
brought

put
another
world
into
that
whole
world
and
have
takenthat
enriched

and
galloped
to
wherever
they
think
they
are
going

but
theyll
never
get
back
to
it
because
these
are
changed
littlepeople
theyll
never
look
at
art
the
same
way
or
a
horse
the
same
waythat
is
the
secret
power
of
artits
about
imagination
and
the
ability
to
imagine
she
says
televisionand
movies
steal
our
ability
to
imagine
and
thats
a
killer
for
poetrywithout
the
ability
to
imagine
you
cant
really
read
but
you
particularlycant
read
poetry
unless
you
can
picture
in
your
mind
everything
thatpasses
in

of
you
in
a
poem
you
get
nothing
out
of
it
i
cant
teachstudents
to
write
until
i
teach
them
how
to
think
metaphorically
in
animagebased

kids
in

were
kids
who
had
seen
everything

they
really
wanted
to
go
to
this

although
its
veryhard
and
if
they
dont
stick
with
it
they
are
out
i
laid
out
thepaintings
and
we
started
talking
about
them
they
are
very
