carefully

for

concluded
that
itsimply
is
not
possible
for

to
restrict
theavailability
of

the

the

an

process
that
doesnot

human
intervention

because

the

id
at
aa
chief
judge
sloviter
summarized
the
courts
factualconclusions
as
follows
we
have
found
that
no
technology
exists
which
allows
those
posting
protected
but
indecent
material
on
the
category
of
newsgroups
mail
exploders
or
chat
rooms
to
screen
for
age
speakers
using
those
forms
of
communication
cannot
control
who
receives
the
communication
and
in
most
instances
are
not
aware
of
the
identity
of
the
recipients
if
it
is
not
feasible
for
speakers
who
communicate
via
these
forms
of
communication
to
conduct
age
screening
they
would
have
to
reduce
the
level
of
communication
to
that
which
is
appropriate
for
children
in
order
to
be
protected
under
the
statute
this
would
effect
a
complete
ban
even
for
adults
of
some
expression
albeit
indecent
to
which
they
are
constitutionally
entitled
even
as
to
content
providers
in
the
other
broad
category
such
as
the
world
wide
web
where
efforts
at
age
verification
are
technically
feasible
through
the
use
of
common
gateway
interface
cgi
scripts
the
findings
of
fact
show
that
as
a
practical
matter
noncommercial
organizations
and
even
many
commercial
organizations
using
the
web
would
find
it
prohibitively
expensive
and
burdensome
to
engage
in
the
methods
of
age
verification
proposed
by
the
government
and
that
even
if
they
could
attempt
to
age
verify
there
is
little
assurance
that
they
could
successfully
filter
out
minorsjs
app
a
in
their
findings
of
fact
the
three
judgesbelow
found
as
facts
that
many
speakers
who
display
arguably
indecent
content

must
choose
between
silence

the

not
