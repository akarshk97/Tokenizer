important

chief

summarized
the
courts
factualconclusions
as
follows
we
have
found
that
no

exists
which
allows
those
posting
protected
but
indecent
material
on
the
category
of
newsgroups

for
age
speakers

those
forms
of
communication
cannot
control
who
receives
the
communication
and
in
most
instances
are
not
aware
of
the
identity
of
the
recipients
if
it
is
not
feasible
for
speakers
who
communicate
via
these
forms
of
communication
to
conduct
age
screening
they
would
have
to
reduce
the
level
of
communication
to
that
which
is
appropriate
for
children
in
order
to
be
protected
under
the
statute
this
would
effect
a
complete
ban
even
for
adults
of
some
expression
albeit
indecent
to
which
they
are
constitutionally
entitled
even
as
to
content
providers
in
the
other
broad
category

as
the
world
wide
web
where
efforts
at
age
verification
are
technically
feasible
through
the
use
of
common
gateway
interface
cgi
scripts
the
findings
of
fact
show
that
as
a
practical
matter
noncommercial
organizations
and
even
many
commercial
organizations
using
the
web
would
find
it
prohibitively
expensive
and
burdensome
to
engage
in
the
methods
of
age
verification
proposed
by
the
government
and
that
even
if
they
could
attempt
to
age
verify
there
is
little
assurance
that
they
could
successfully
filter

the

the

the

based
on

its
conclusion
regarding

clearly
correct
the
government
also
now
for
the

timeinterprets
section
223d1a

that
section223d1a
could
and

be
interpreted
to
reach
anypatently

made
using

the

sent

section
223d1a
imposesvirtually
the

restrictions
on

as
does
the

and
presentsthe

constitutional
problems
not
surprisingly
thedistrict

concluded
that

of
the
cda
are
unconstitutional
on
their
face
js
app

based
on
the
arguments
made

this
conclusion
was
clearly
correct
in

the

violatesthe

it

protected

definitivelyand
officially
construing
those
other
provisions
to
applyonly
when
the
speaker
knows
that
the

this

should

it
should
