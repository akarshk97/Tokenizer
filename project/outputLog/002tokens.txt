appreciatethe
opportunity
to

before
you
today
on
behalf
of
cdt
in
supportof
the
need
for
strong
comprehensive
federal
legislation
to
protect
theconfidentiality
of
medical
records
one
of
cdts
primary
goals
is
the
passage
of
federal
legislation
that
establishesstrong
enforceable
privacy
protection
for
personally
identifiable
healthinformation
we
believe
that
comprehensive
legislation
that
protects
theprivacy
of
health
information
is
critical
the
public
will
not
have
trustand
confidence
in
the
emerging
health
information
infrastructure
if
theirsensitive
health
data
is
vulnerable
to
abuse
and
misuse
we
commend
theefforts
of
chairman
horn
and
representative
gary
a
condit
for
their
leadershiptowards
enacting
legislation
to
protect
the
privacy
of
health
informationpresently
there
is
no
comprehensive
federal
law
that
protects
peopleshealth
records
however
a
louis
harris
survey
found
that
most
people
inthis
country
mistakenly
believe
their
personal
health
information
is
currentlyprotected
by
law
and
most
people
mistakenly
believe
they
have
a
right
toaccess
their
own
medical
information
in
fact
only
28
states
allow
patientsaccess
to
their
own
medical
records
and
only
34
states
have
confidentialitylaws
federal
privacy
policy
is
urgently
needed
to
address
the
increasingdemands
for
health
information
by
those
outside
the
traditional

companies
managed

companies
researchers

confidentiality
that
is
central
to

cdt
believescongress
must
act
to
protect
the
privacy
of
personally
identifiable
healthinformation
so
that
our
laws
will
finally
conform
to
some
extent
withthe
american
publics
perception
and
expectation
that
their
sensitive
medicalrecords
are
confidentialtechnological
innovations
that
allow
medical

data
and

tobe
transferred
easily
over
great
distances
impacts
our
country
in
significantways
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
and
informationsuperhighway
are
changing
the
ways
that
we
deal
with
each
other
traditionalbarriers
of
distance
time
and
location
are
disappearing
as
informationand
transactions
become
computerized
few
relationships
in
the
healthcare
field
will
remain
unaffected
by
these
changes
in
the
absence
of
anycongressional
action
the
collection
and
use
of
personally
identifiablehealth
information
will
continue
to
occur
within
electronic
networked
environmentswithout
privacy
protectionsbut
while
this
information
revolution
may
hold
great
promise
for
enhancingour
nations
health
cdt
and
others
believe
that
personal
health
informationin
both
paper

must
be
protected
by
strong

even

pose
potential

ota

the
shortcomings

however

the

many

some

in

is
common
for
patients
to
ask

not

this
means
thatindividuals

moreover

records
in

deserve

but
the
vulnerability
of

to
unauthorized
accessand
use
grows
exponentially
as
the
computer
makes
possible
the
instant
sharingof
information
as
a
1992
study
by
the
workgroup
for
electronic
data
interchangewedi
pointed
out
the
paper
medium
is
cumbersome
and
expensiveironicallyit
is
the
negative
impact
of
the
paper
mediumthat
has
minimized
the
riskof
breaches
of
confidentiality
although
a
breach
could
occur
if
someonegave
access
to
health
records
or
insurance
claim
forms
the
magnitude
ofthe
breach
was
limited
by
the
sheer
difficulty
of
unobtrusively
reviewinglarge
numbers
of
records
or
claim
formsnevertheless
technology
itself
is
not
the
evil
information
systems
canactually
be
designed
to
promote
the
confidentiality
and
security
of
personalinformation
for
instance
a
welldesigned
computerized
system
can
moreclosely
guard
individual
privacy
than
paper
filing
systems
the
key
isto
recognize
technologys
potential
to
enhance
privacy
not
simply
to
focuson
the
risks
technology
poses
to
undermine
privacy
there
is
widespreadagreement
among
privacy
and
security
experts
that
protections
must
be
buildin
on
the
frontend
it
is
too
difficult
and
risky
to
enact
them
only
aftera
major
privacy
breach
privacy
and
security
must
regain
their
own
placeas
cornerstones
of
the
medical
relationship
only
then
can
we
achieve
thepotential
for

believes
that
the
protection
of
personally

health

critical
to
ensuring
public
trust
and
confidence
in
the
emerging
healthinformation
infrastructure
health
care
reform
cannot
move
forward
withoutassuring
the
american
public
that
the
highly
sensitive
personal
informationcontained
in
their
medical
records
will
be
protected
from
abuse
and
misuseas
the
harris
surveys
indicate
people
are
highly
suspicious
of
large
scalecomputerization
and
believe
that
their
health
records
are
in
dire
need
ofprivacy
protection
if
people
are
expected
to
embrace
and
participate
inthis
rapidly
changing
health
environment
the
price
of
their
participationmust
not
be
the
loss
of
control
of
sensitive
personal

system
that
fails
to
win
the
publics
trust
will
fail
to
win
the
publicssupport
we
risk
having
individuals
withdraw
from
the
full
and
honest
participationin
their
own
health
care
because
they
fear
losing
their

congressshould
not
allow
people
to
fall
through
the
cracks
of
the

systembecause
the
privacy
of

is
unprotected
we
urgeyou
to
move
