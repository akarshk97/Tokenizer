these

ike
the
world
is
what
you
think
it
is
when
we
criticizeanother
we
are
implying
that
heshe
is
not
acting
in
accordancewith
our
personal
framework
of
reality
however
everyone
hastheir
own
individual
perception
of
what
reality
is
accordingto
their
own
beliefs
and
assumptions
about
life
our
personalview
is
only
whats
true
for
us
yet
we
tend
to
invalidatewhat
we
do
not
understand
if
we
truly
love
another
then
we
striveto
understand
their
point
of
view
it
is
every
bit
as
valid
tothem
as
ours
is
to
us
and
provides
the
balancing
polarity
toour
point
of
view
according
to
the
principle
of
ike
you
mustbless
anothers
contrasting
viewpoint
if
you
want
yours
tobe
accepted
or
blessed
in
return2
kala
in
a
world
of
no
limits
we
can
have
allencompassingunity
of
all
things
and
all
beings
we
are
intimately
connectedto
each
other
and
to
everything
in
existence
every
thought
producesan
effect
at
some
level
therefore
when
we
criticize
someonewe
are
asking
to
be
criticized
but
when
you
find
yourself
hatinganother
for
the
way
they
act
towards
you
you
may
findifyou
look
closely
at
yourselfthat
you
too
are
guilty
of
actingthe
same
waythe
beauty
of
this
principle
is
that
when
you
bless
anotheryou
are
blessing
yourself
as
well
and
you
will
be
blessed
byothers
when
you
bless
anything
you
are
being
blessed
we
aretruly
one
being
sharing
one
mind
and
growing
through
all
matterand
many
faces
this
concept
of
oneness
explains
why
telepathyworks
and
why
the
collective
thought
forms
of
the
masses
createour
reality
here
on
earth3
makia
if
energy
flows
where
our
attention
goes
and
weget
what
we
focus
on
then
it
is
wise
to
look
closely
at
the
objectof
our
focus
if
we
pay
close
attention
to
what
we
dontlike
about
an
individual
then
it
grows
in
our
awareness
and
experiencewith
them
by
focusing
on
the
good
in
them
we
can
experienceand
bless
that
instead
according
to
this
third
principle
youare
where
your
attention
is
because
you
are
your
attention

the
third
principle
leads
into
the
fourth
accordingto
which
now
is
the
moment
of
power
how
many
of
us
live
in
themoment
and
appreciate
its
beauty
and
grace
when
we
can
approacheach
moment
without
judgement
it
reveals
itself
as
a
holy
instantwaiting
to
be
born
into
our
awareness
every
moment
is
a
miracleof
life
propelled
forth
by
the
previous
moment
if
you
trace
yourthoughts
back
in
time
you
will
find
that
your
current
situationsand
relationships
are
truly
designed
by
your
thinking
only
decisionsthat
you
make
right

concept
is
one
of

who

ofdoubting
appreciate
instead
of
