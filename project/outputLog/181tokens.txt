vanston

said
it
may
well
bethat
the

is
in
for
a
year
when
the
pace

ifanything

such
an
acceleration
is

occurringacross

by

competitors
arrive
on

and
by
a
stream
oftechnological
advancesand
against
a
backdrop
where
wirelesstelephony
becomes
a
widespread
reality
in
more

overseas
but
this
is
not
to

that
there
are

however
it

all

there
is
one
sizable

wireless

the

also

if

howeverfinlands
nokia

may
be
the
first
to
take

the

of

that
can
be
used
either
for

or
a

the
base

aredesigned
to
bolster

stadelmann
said
according
to
an

in

the

assigned

areas
potential

and
another
6

costs
moreover
in
limiting
its
pcn
coverage
to
urban
areas
stadelmannsaid
that
swiss

has
found
that
it
can
devise
a
rate
structurethat
offers
greater
appeal
to
the
more
priceconscious
segment
of
thewireless

market
by
setting

close

swisstelecom
hopes
to
induce

from

for

it

but
that
of

first
wouldrequire

all
stadelmann
