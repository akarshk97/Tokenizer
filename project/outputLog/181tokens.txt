but
there
is
one
sizable
problem
wireless

need
to
speed
up
efforts
to
bring

the
subject

howeverfinlands

the

for

of

that
can
be

either
for

the

aredesigned

stadelmann
said
according
to
an

in

the

areas
potential

moreover
in

stadelmannsaid
that
swiss

has
found
that
it
can
devise
a
rate
structurethat
offers
greater
appeal
to
the
more
priceconscious
segment
of
thewireless

market
by

swisstelecom
hopes
to
induce

from

for

mobility
it
affords
but
that
of
course
first
wouldrequire
a

all
stadelmann
could
