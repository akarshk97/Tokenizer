canadian
author
of

for

strongly
agrees
with
nicola
teslasprediction
and
in
fact
envisions
that
production

are
just
around
the
corner
on

manning
states
there
is
a

it

dramatically
change
our

our

our

it

provide

every

of

with
a
truly
unique
sense
of

will
mark
the

the

a

time
in

we
will
all
haveour

of
nonpolluting

will
powerour

our

ten

movement
i
was
living
in
vernon
bc
and
heard
about
an
inventorin
penticton
who
invented
an
extraordinary
magnetic
dynamo
henamed
his
company
pran
tech
because
he
believed
that
powerfulmagnets
somehow
suck
in
the
pranaa
subtle
energyrecognized
by
the
ancientsfrom
the
air
around
us
usinga
superefficient
arrangement
of
permanent
magnets
and
electricalcoils
he
claimed
the
machine
when
fully
developed
would
put
outmore
electricity
than
it
took
to
run
it
i
didnt
understand
the
technical
explanations
at
thetime
but
i
was
convinced
that
he
sincerely
wanted
to
help
cleanup
the
planet
with

i
thoughtif
this
is
real
we
wont
need
to
dam
any
more
wildrivers
or
poison
the
air
if
it
is
bona

then
as
a
journalisti
want
to
spread

it

the

instead
a
small

free

is

manning
points
out
because
there

cost

with

even
