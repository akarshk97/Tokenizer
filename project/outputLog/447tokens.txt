numerous

according
tothe

an
investigation
going

concerning

i
cant
imagine
anyone
associatinghimherself
with
such

especially
if
there

going

likely
is
the

asked
to
produce
a
report

itssignificance
using
all
the
latest

think
your
last
sentence
hits
it
on
the
head
the
new
nuclearproblems
out
of
the
old
ussr
have
indeed
gotten
short
shrift
in
factlast
year
there
was
a
bit
of
a
scandal
regarding
germanys
bnd
and
whatmay
have
been
a
setup
to
sting
such
people
as
loutchansky
might
be
themain
significance
is
that
there
is
clearly
a
market
for
this
and
when
youcombine
it
with
what
i
think
david
huff
was
pointing
out
in
his
earlierpost
on
mininukes
it
does
serve
to
lower
