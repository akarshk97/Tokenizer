comes
in
its
own
timeby
rick
gossettin
earlier
cultures
the
shaman
was
usually
present
at
the
deathof
an
individual
to
help
their
soul
to
move
on
to
heaven
thevalhallah
the
light
or
whatever
the
other
side
wasperceived
to
be
it
was
a
time
of
healing
for
the
family
and
communityand
it
is
a
process
now
referred
to
as
psychopompunfortunately
in
our
modern
culture
people
die
and
there
isno
such
spirit
work
done
the
family
is
often
spread
out
overthe
country
and
they
may
not
even
gather
for
the
funeral
yetthe
work
is
there
souls
that
are
either
confused
obstinate
orhave
unfinished
business
do
not
move
on
to
the
spirit
world
the
following
two
examples
demonstrate
the
significance
of
thiskind
of
work
a
man
from
my
mentor
group
in
seattle
was
calledto
go
to
malaysia
where
a
huge
clothing
store
had
collapsed
killinghundreds
of
people
however
he
returned
from
his
trip
lookingvery
puzzled
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
very
many
souls
ourgroup
contributed
this
to
the
fact
that
malaysia
had
a
culturewhich
took
care
of
this
kind
of
work
but
the
news
later
reportedthe
loss
of
only
six
lives
the
rest
of
the
bodieswere
store
dummies
the
second
example
involves
my
grandmother
who
died
last
monthat
95
a
very
angry
and
bitter
woman
she
was
estranged
from
herfamily
so
i
had
only
met
her
a
few
times
i
had
no
grief
or
senseof
loss
at
her
passing
yet
i
felt
compelled
to
do
somethingat
the
time
of
her
funeral
which
was
being
held
in
another
partof
the
countryi
journeyed
and
asked
my
totems
to
take
me
to
her
spirit
knowingthat
she
was
probably
still
around
when
i
found
her
she
wasso
angry
that
i
couldnt
get
close
to
her
not
knowing
whatelse
to
do
i
began
to
sing
to
her
she
stopped
her
raging
andlooked
at
me
seeing
me
for
the
first
time
my
mind
said
thatwe
were
family
that
we
shared
the
same
genes
but
that
it
wentdeeper
than
that
she
was
a
good
woman
who
had
had
a
bad
lifeand
i
cared
for
her
i
saw
her
soul
that
soul
part
though
attenuatedin
her
looked
back
at
me
and
responded
at
this
point
in
the
journey
my
face
was
wet
with
tears
i
heldout
my
hands
to
her
and
she
came
to
me
as
she
came
a
largeheavy
cloak
dropped
away
from
her
she
was
young
again
and
smilingstill
singing
i
turned
her
towards
the
light
just
before
shewent
into
it
she
turned
and
threw
back
several
things
they
flutteredand
were
gone
she
smiled
again
and
said
i
dont
reallyneed
those
and
they
are
not
mine
anyway
then
she
was
gonethey
had
been
soul
parts
that
she
had
stolen
they
were
now
freeto
return
to
those
to
whom
they
belonged
as
the
light
expandedso
did
the
joy
in
my
heart
i
returned
from
my
journey
knowingthat
healing
comes
in
its
own
timeas
it
did
for
my
grandmotherand
for
me
