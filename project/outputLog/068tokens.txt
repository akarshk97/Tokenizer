overviewthe
aesop
1000
ds
has
been
designed
to
provide
a
robotic
developmentplatform
for
research
applications
this
system
allows
all
ofthe
command
modes
of
the
standard
aesop
1000
system
but
alsoadds
the
flexibility
of
pc
communication
directly
with
the
aesopcontroller
the
flexibility
of
the
ds
system
allows
a
platformfor
building
new
robotic
applications
and
laparoscopic
researchsystem
usagethe
ds
system
like
the
aesop
1000
is
intended
for
use
in
a
laparoscopicsetting
where
the
robots
end
effector
is
attached
to
a
fixedpivotlaparoscope
the
ds
system
is
not
intended
for
clinical
use
andrequires
a
pc
connection
to
function
the
user
is
provided
witha
disk
containing
the
aesop
system
software
a

programand
a
library
of
movement
and
data
collection
routinesto
use
the
system
aesop
is
connected
to
the
pc
through
the
serialport
the
file
transfer
software
is
loaded
on
the
pc
and
the
systemsoftware
can
then
be
loaded
through
the
serial
port
once
thisis
done
the
system
can
be
used
within
the
standard
aesop
commandmodes
eg
using
the
foot
and
hand
controls
manual
mode
andmemory
positions
the
user
can
also
send
and
receive
additionaldata
from
the
pc
through
the
serial
portresearch
applicationswith
the
serial
port
users
can
send
data
to
and
receive
datafrom
the
aesop
system
a
library
of
commands
is
provided
on
afloppy
disk
for
example
the
robots
individual
joints
can
becommanded
to
move
to
specific
locations
the
system
can
send
backinformation
about
joint
positions
and
movement
histories
in
addition
other
interfaces
may
be
used
to
control
therobot
for
example
the
robot
could
be
moved
