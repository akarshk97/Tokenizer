art
of

good
to
be
a
seeker
but
sooner
or
later
you
have
to
be
afinder
and
then
it
is
well
to
give
what
you
have
found
a
giftinto
the
world
for
whoever
will
accept
itjonathan

people
go
through
life
seeking
and
never
finding

find
and
then
assist
others

their
own
questsbarbara
mindell
started
her
search
shortly
after
a
car
crash
atthe
age
of
left
her
a
paraplegic
while
no
one
at
the
hospitaltold
her
she
would
never
walk
again
it
was
the
impression
shewas
left
with
i
never
really
bought
the
idea
that
id
neverwalk
she
says
if
there
was
a
god
there
was
a
possibilitythat
i
could
recover
from
this
injuryconventional
north
american
medical
wisdom
didnt
have
the
answersshe
was
looking
for
doctors
think
about
the
human
bodyas
one
would
a
car
or
a
machine
once
grown
it
doesnt
grow
orregenerate
it
eventually
falls
apart
and
they
just
fix
the
partsalong
the
way
she
says
mindell
spent
the
next
ten
yearsexploring
the
alternative
healing
methods
including
bodyworkmassage
and
acupuncture
she
sent
out
form
letters
to
healthand
scientific
organizations
around
the
world
asking
people
towork
with
her
she
received
nothing
more
than
good
wishes
in
replyin
the
course
of
her
search
mindell
met
emilie
conraddaoudand
was
introduced
to
continuumsomething
she
describes
as
aprimary
movement
process
which
explores
movement
as
somethingwe
are
rather
than
something
we
do
conraddaoud
inventedand
developed
this
process
which
mindell
says
is
an
everchangingeverevolving
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
what
it
means
to
be
ahuman
beingmindell
learned
from
conraddaoud
to
breathe
in
a
manner
thatcreated
a
wavelike
motion
generated
from
the
part
of
her
bodythat
could
move
the
wave
motion
radiates
through
the
body
spreadingtiny
movements
and
signaling
dormant
areas
to
participate
theconcept
has
been
described
as
breaking
ice
to
get
to
watermindell
suggests
we
entertain
the
notion
that
we
are
open
systemswith
endless
possibilities
for
innovation
and
the
developmentof
new
neural
pathways
new
connections
new
ways
to
identifyourselves
she
describes
her
experience
with
the
continuum
ashaving
been
a
way
to
transform
herself
its
like
entering
intoa
new
life
shedding
an
old
skinand
doing
it
in
a
loving
environmentshe
saysconraddaoud
teaches
that
human
beings
develop
in
an
aquaticatmosphere
while
in
the
womb
and
are
fundamentally
aquatic
beingsour
earliest
developments
take
place
with
movements
similar
tothose
of
the

to

the
more
specific
a
movement
is
such
as

less
neural

there
is

for

movements

the

the

for

may
also
be

realized
the
healing
had
to
come
from
within
itwasnt
a
process
where
the
patient
is
passive
and
the
otherperson
fixes
them
she
saysi
had
a
willingness
to
participate
i
was
ready
the
spiritualaspect
of
the
healing
for
me
was
allimportant
as
i
started
toget
sensation
as
i
started
to
move
areas
of
my
body
that
wereparalyzed
showed
me
that
movement
and
sensation
were
the
resultof
a
much
deeper
process
i
went
through
a
long
process
of
lettinggo
of
the
struggling
against
the
paralysis
theres
a
lot
of
thatin
living
a
life
in
a
wheelchair
forcing
and
pushing
strugglingmindell
says
she
was
able
to
become
more
general
in
her
awarenessand
not
always
focus
on
her
legs
and
wanting
to
walk
itsreally
not
a
process
of
dealing
directly
with
the
issue
itsmuch
more
expansive
in
any
transformation
process
you
cantbe
overly
focused
on
paralysis
it
creates
more
of
the
samealoop
so
for
myself
in
this
process
it
hasnt
been
just
healingthe
paralysis
its
more
than
just
thatspiritual
growth
developmentbeing
able
to
have
a
full
life
have
a
career
as
an
artist
beingin
a
relationship
and
being
able
to
move
in
many
different
waysthrough
this
process
the
increase
in
sensation
has
been
enormousthe
feeling
of
fluidity
and
movement
in
my
body
has
been
an
incrediblehealingalthough
not
quite
ambulatory
mindell
now
has
sensation
andmovement
throughout
her
lower
body
her
investigation
into

led
to
profound
insights
into
the
creative
capacity
of

has

implications
