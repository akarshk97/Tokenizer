of
us
spend
our
lives
operating
in
high
gear
dashing
fromone
appointment
to
another
grabbing
a
bite
to
eat
in
betweenmeetings
getting
stressed
in
traffic
jams
and
being
overwhelmedby
our
workload
we
think
our
problem
is
time
or
the
lack
of
itbut
it
is
not
our
problem
is
really
lack
of
order
in
other
wordsit
is
chaosif
everything
were
orderly
we
would
have
a
relaxed
enjoyablebreakfast
that
would
be
well
digested
if
order
prevailed
in
trafficwe
could
calmly
find
our
place
in
the
rush
and
go
with
the
flowwithout
being
obstructed
by
old
ladies
or
harassed
by
the
badtaxi
drivers
our
telephone
would
ring
just
when
we
were
readyto
accept
calls
our
email
messages
would
have
been
sorted
outin
their
order
of
priority
and
our
coffee
break
would
be
exactlythata
coffee
breakbut
alas
our
world
appears
to
be
unavoidably
chaotic
and
mustbe
negotiated
as
well
as
possible
yet
this
perspective
is
basedon
the
old
paradigm
science
and
systems
theory
tell
us
that
chaosis
not
an
element
of
randomness
but
rather
a
lack
of
understandingof
the
level
and
complexity
of
orderin
a
nonlinear
universe
what
we
call
chaos
is
in
fact
thefreedom
of
movement
or
latitude
given
to
the
elements
of
the
systemto
be
able
to
evolve
through
selforganization
whether
we
lookat
the
spontaneous
concentration
of
the
gases
around
the
denserclouds
shortly
after
the
big
bang
or
the
spontaneous
evolutionof
the
chemical
soup
into
the
first
life
form
or
the
gatheringof
the
first
hunter
tribe
of
apes
to
form
the
first
communityof
humankind
we
see
selforganization
at
workthe
constantlychanging
yet
somewhat
predictable
weather
patternsthe
seeming
chaos
of
a
bee
hive
and
even
the
spontaneous
creationof
political
movements
such
as
communism
the
reform
party
orross
perot
are
all
expressions
of
selforganization
at
workselforganization
is
an
essential
part
and
mechanism
of
evolutionand
chaos
is
the
initial
condition
that
gives
rise
to
order
itwas
this
same
mechanism
that
created
the
civil
rights
movementthe
feminist
movement
and
the
environmental
movement
it
was
chaosthat
triggered
the
fall
of
the
berlin
wall
the
collapse
of
thecommunist
bloc
and
the
freedom
of
nelson
mandelait
was
also
chaos
that
brought
about
the
downfall
of
the
mainframecomputer
in
favour
of
the
pc
the
resurgence
of
alternative
healingagainst
the
institutional
medical
structures
and
the
embracingof
spirituality
as
a
reaction
to
the
rationalistic
materialismof
the
previous
erachaos
is
necessary
and
chaos
is
good
whenever
a
system
has
reacheda
static
point
of
equilibrium
and
has
no
more
room
to
grow
andevolve
it
is
fertile
ground
for
chaos
to
take
over
in
a
chaoticenvironment
ideas
flourish
limitations
and
boundaries
dissolverisks
are
taken
opportunities
arise
and
many
attempts
lead
tofailurebut
it
is
out
of
the
same
trials
that
eventually
one
or
more
attemptsevolve
as
the
most
likely
to
succeed
and
flourish
and
then
theother
elements
within
that
stillchaotic
system
spontaneouslydecide
in
favour
of
some
of
the
alternatives
that
are
most
likelyto
succeed
and
through
a
mechanism
of
selfdetermination
organizethemselves
in
line
with
their
chosen
paths
of
evolution
thisis
the
mechanism
of
selforganization
it
is
evolution
throughthe
exercise
of
freedom
of
choiceoften
chaos
evolves
much
better
than
order
we
have
all
noticedthat
when
a
traffic
light
is
out
of
order
there
is
actually
lesstraffic
congestion
and
cars
move
more
quickly
and
easily
thatis
because
the
mind
of
the
selforganizing
system
takes
over
andpushes
the
imposed
rules
aside
voting
in
favour
of
selfregulationand
orderly
traffic
movementfollowing
the
same
model
in
many
of
the
forwardthinking
corporationsa
structured
and
hierarchical
management
with
imposed
rules
hasgiven
way
to
a
flat
functional
and
selfregulating
organizationthe
only
problem
with
chaos
is
that
as
individuals
working
withinthe
chaotic
system
we
have
neither
the
foresight
nor
the
insightto
grasp
the
bigger
picture
we
are
too
involved
in
finding
ourway
through
the
mess
we
are
too
preoccupied
with
answering
thattelephone
call
or
avoiding
that
bad
driverparticularly
at
the
onset
of
a
chaotic
system
which
is
alwaysfragile
too
much
energy
seems
to
be
wasted
we
keep
going
backand
forth
spinning
our
wheels
avoiding
undesirable
situationsor
even
trying
to
restore
the
status
quo
we
are
too
busy
addressingour
fearsso
chaos
is
not
the
problem
either
the
problem
is
merely
ourperception
of
chaos
if
we
could
simply
see
the
usefulness
ofchaos
and
give
it
the
right
perspective
in
our
lives
then
wecould
deal
with
it
appropriately
without
fearing
it
in
factwe
might
even
want
to
create
chaos
and
trust
that
the
mind
ofthe
system
would
lead
to
selforganization
spontaneously
withoutmuch
effort
on
our
partand
still
in
the
bigger
picture
if
we
can
see
the
universe
asa
selforganizing
system
that
has
worked
for
billions
of
yearswithout
any
help
or
direction
from
us
if
we
could
only
recognizegod
as
the
mind
of
the
universe
and
not
merely
as
its
creatorthen
we
would
trust
natures
selforganization
capabilitywe
would
not
try
to
dominate
or
subjugate
it
we
would
simplyrecognize
chaos
as
part
of
growth
and
very
calmly
proceed
withour
lives
without
wasting
any
energy
on
