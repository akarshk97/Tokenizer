certain
times
each
month
are
poor
times
to
make
major
decisions
or
purchases
these
are
the
times
when
your
purchases
turn
out
to
be
something
you
never
wear
or
use
they
are
also
disastrous
times
to
hold
important
meetingswhen
the
moon
is
void
of
course
we
become
like
floating
balloons
of
helium
and
cant
trust
our
decisionmaking
skills
because
we
are
not
grounded
whatever
we
initiate
during
these
times
tends
not
to
fulfill
its
purposekeep

the
times
