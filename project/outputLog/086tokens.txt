using

the
robot
program
was
generated
entirely
by
using
the
teach
pendant
on
the
shop
floor
since
9
axes
are
used
it
can
be
difficult
for
the
operator
to
visualise
all
possible
configurations
due
to
the
size
of
the
ibeams
cimtas
have
encountered
many
problems
in
getting
the
robots
to
achieve
satisfactory
welds
without
exceeding
a
robot
joint
limit
or
having
the
welding
tool
collide
with
the
workpiece
it
is
possible
to
move
the
robot
up
and
down
along
the
vertical
track
b
but
only
by
unbolting
it
and
winching
it
into
position
this
makes
it
difficult
to
experiment

different

solutiona
model
of
the
workcell
was
created
with
workspace
and
the
srv12l
and
arcmate
were
compared
for
reachability
the
workspace
facility
to
plot
the
working
envelope
was
used
to
position
the
work
piece
optimally
it
was
immediately
found
that
in
this
application
the
reis
srv12l
robot
allowed
a
greater
working
envelope
so
this
robot
was
chosen
in
place
of
the
arcmate
for
the
workcellby
using
workspace
it
was
possible
to
make
the
vertical
track
b
a
translational
joint
on
the
rotating
column
a
this
allowed
the
height
of
the
robot
to
be
optimised
by
simply
changing
a
variable
in
the
simulation
work
then
began
on
developing
a
set
of
teach
points
which
the
robot
could
follow
without
hitting
a
joint
limit
or
colliding
with
the
workpieceit
was
found
that
repositioning
the
column
a
between
welds
enabled
several
particularly
difficult
moves
to
be
achieved
previously
cimtas
had
simply
placed
the
mechanism
so
that
it
was
at
right
angles
to
the
linear
track
c
for
the
duration
of
the
cyclecollisions
tended
to
arise
if
the
robot
was
forced
to
reorient
the
wrist
during
a
linear
move
along
a
welding
seam
the
simulation
highlights
any
collisions
and
allows
the
user
to
abandon
a
move

immediately
try
another
