city
andlater
for
hereford
before
rheumatoid
arthritis
forced
him
to
quitamidst
much
publicity
at
the
age
of

he
turned
to
journalismand
then
to
television
becoming
a
sports
correspondent
on
bbc2s
newsnight
and
contributing
regularly
to
bbc
1sgrandstand
he
went
on
to
become
a
national
spokesman
for
britainsgreen
party
and
became
deeply
involved
in
environmental
issuesa
visit
to
a
british
medium
and
healer
in
1990
set
him
on
thejourney
of
discovery
which
dramatically
changed
his
life
and
ledhim
to
write
a
series
of
controversial
books
including
truth

doesnt
have
to
be
this
way

the
world
and
the
robotsrebellion
his
most
recent
is
and
the
truth
will
set
you
freeand
has
been
described
as
the
most
explosive
book
of
the
20thcentury
it
reveals
the
esoteric
background
to
a
worldwide
conspiracyto
centralize
power
within
the
hands
of
a
global
elite
in
ithe
offers
an
inspiring
spiritual
solution
in
which
every
manwoman
and
child
can
break
free
from
robotic
programming
and
takeback
their
power
to
decide
their
own
destiny
icke
is
travelling
around
the
world
explaining
the
danger
to
thefuture
of
our
planet
posed
by
the
present
worldwide
economic
systemnow
dominated
and
controlled
by
a
secret
global
elite
the
bottomline
of
this
system
is
economic
growthwhich
economists
claim
leads
to
more
jobs
more
wealth
for
theelite
more
economic
success
etc
this
couldntbe
more
simple
but
in
truth
it
is
a
take
make
and
throw
awaysystem
which
increases
the
rate
and
amount
of
irreplaceable
resourceswe
take
from
the
planet
every
year
it
increases
the
speed
atwhich
these
products
most
of
which
we
dont
need
are
madeobsolete
or
wear
out
so
that
people
are
forced
to
buy
the
sameproducts
again
and
again
in
order
to
generate
ever
greater
increasesin
production
this
in
turn
leads
to
the
increase
in
the
amountof
natural
resources
now
called
waste
and
rubbish
that
we
throwaway
every
yearit
must
have
taken
a
genius
to
come
up
with
it
because
as
ickesays
it
is
the
perfect
environmental
and
human
assassinand
yet
it
is
the
system
that
controls
the
world
and
the
mindsof
its
people
in
short
for
the
present
system
to
survive
andincrease
production
every
year
it
is
essential
that
we
rape
theplanet
for
more
and
more
resources
and
poison
her
with
ever
morepollution
this
is
the
system
supported
by
every
major
politicalmovement
in
the
world
except
for
the
greens
this
is
the
conventionalwisdom
that
is
destroying
the
earth
also

present

which
appear
to
occur
independentlyof
each

but
in
truth
have
the
same
people
pulling
the
stringsin
all
of
them
its
becoming
increasingly
true
that
a
veryfew
people
control
the
world
by
persuading
and
pressuring
thepopulation
through
fear
to
think
the
way
they
want
them
to
actand

or
preferably
not
to
act
or
think
independently
atall
currently
four
multinational
corporations

90
ofthe
global

explains
what
happens
in
practice
is
that
if
you
lookat
all
the
dogmas
in
all
cultures
all
societies
have

it
is

etc
whereinif
you
conform
to
it
you
are
in
the
comfort
zone
no
onesgoing
to
laugh
at
you
condemn
you
for
being
different
or
forexpressing
your
uniqueness
because
you
are
locked
into
the
herdmentality
and
you
are
conforming
to
what
you
are
told
you
shouldbe
and
do
when
you
step
out
of
this
mindset
and
express
yourunique
aspect
of
all
that
exists
and
refuse
to
be
frightenedor
controlled
you
immediately
face
ridicule
or
condemnation
asi
have
in

connects
and
links

ideas
with
thespiritual
he
first
explains
how
we
are
giving
our
minds
awayand
the
means
through
which
we
are
conditioned
to
do
that
hediscloses
a
vast
number
of
names
and
organizations
which
are
veryfamous
and
of
people
who
are
in
the
controlling
hierarchy
includingthe
us
president
he
says
i
do
not
do
this
out
of
condemnationbecause
the
people
involved
are
expressing
their
own
state
ofbeing
at
the
time
they
are
also
reflecting
back
to
us
the
collectivehuman
mind
itself
and
the
results
of
our
own
lack
of
personalresponsibility
and
integrity
i
think
that
it
is
important
todo
this
firsti
also
point
out
how
the
same
people
on
apparently
differentsides
of
politics
are
actually
connected
to
the
same
elite
organizationsthese
organizations
have
the
same
proven
agenda
of
a
world
governmenta
world
central
bank
a
world
army
a
world
currency
and
somesay
a
microchipped
population
these
apparent
opposites
in
politicsare
there
to
persuade
us
that
we
are
not
living
in
a
prison
thatwe
have
a
choice
yet
these
persons
are
not
opposites
at
all
butare
part
of
a
oneparty
state
the
last
two
us
presidents
wereapparently
opposites
and
on
different
sides
bill
clintonand
george
bushyet
they
were
both
heavily
involved
withinthe
same
elite
organizationsthe
media
and
politicians
have
a
cozy
unwritten
agreementthat
projects
a
myth
to
people
which
is
that
prime
ministerspresidents
and
highranking
politicians
are
the
top
of
the
decisionmakingpyramid
in
the
world
they
then
walk
around
the
world
stage
andact
as
if
they
are
the
final
arbiters
of
power
the
media
goesalong
with
this
which
means
that
the
echelons
above
the
clintonswho
actually
pull
the
strings
never
get
researched
and
investigatedbecause
they
are
invisible
to
the
public
these
are
the
individualswho
decide
who
becomes
president
because
they
own
the
money
andthe
media
the
president
is
only
the
most
famous
frontman
inthe
worldthis
is
also
why
movements
for
social
economic
and
environmentalchanges
are
ineffective
they
are
unable
to
change
the
systembecause
they
are
actually
forced
to
be
part
of
the
system
to
surviveall
of
their
resources
are
expended
on
the
frontmen
while
thereal
power
acts
subversively
behind
the
scenes
to
perpetrate
thesystem
as
it
is
now
also
through
nonprofit
foundations
operatedby
the
elite
many
are
infiltrated
by
agents
who
turn
the
movementsinto
vehicles
to
promote
the
system
most
activists
attack
theelements
of
the
system
they
can
perceive
with
anger
blame
andoften
violence
from
a
spiritual
perspective
it
is
only
possibleto
transform
the
negative
consciousness
of
the
system
with
loveand
compassion
this
is
why
it
is
so
necessary
at
this
time
tomove
to
a
higher
state
of
consciousness
to
solve
our
world
problemsa
mass
mindcontrolling
technique
which
is
used
by
these
eliteorganizations
all
the
time
is
the
problemreactionsolutiona
problem
is
covertly
created
by
the
cia
kgb
etc
and
someoneis
blamed
for
the
problem
the
culprit
might
be
a
war
a
run
onthe
currency
national
debt
or
a
government
collapse
it
canbe
anything
the
media
is
used
to
stimulate
public
opinion
inrelationship
to
the
created
problem
so
that
the
public
cries
outsomething
must
be
done
at
that
point
those
who
createdthe
problem
openly
offer
the
solution
as
a
means
of
getting
whatthey
wanted
all
along
an
example
of
this
icke
explains
is
the
worldarmy
scenario
the
last
thing
that
the
problemreactionsolutionneeded
in
bosnia
was
an
effective
un
peacekeepingoperation
if
it
was
effective
it
would
have
been
so
in
rwandaand
somalia
but
then
there
would
be
no
problem
to
solve
soas
a
result
of
the
un
peacekeeping
operation
not
working
therecontinued
to
be
a
problem
the
un
peacekeeping
was
designed
notto
work
and
was
aided
by
the
major
peace
negotiators
in
bosniawho
incidentally
are
all
members
in
the
same
elite
organizationsthat
have
as
an
agenda
the
creation
of
a
world
armythe
more
horrific
the
pictures
that
came
out
of
bosniathe
louder
came
the
public
outcry
something
must
be
donethis
was
understandable
from
the
publics
point
of
viewbut
the
solution
put
forward
was
the
formation
of
what
is
effectivelya
world
army
a
60000man
force
the
largest
multinationalforce
assembled
since
world
war
ii
and
exactly
what
the
conspiratorswantedicke
operates
on
two
different
levels
the
hereandnow
the
conspiratorialresearch
level
to
assess
what
is
actually
taking
place
and
thespiritual
which
demonstrates
that
if
you
take
your
mind
awaythere
are
physical
consequences
he
says
if
we
take
ourpersonal
and
spiritual
power
back
stop
being
a
herd
of
sheepand
express
our
unique
divine
individuality
then
the
abilityof
a
few
to
control
our
world
disappears
once
people
realizethey
can
control
their
own
lives
that
their
own
power
existswithin
them
rather
than
outside
of
themselves
