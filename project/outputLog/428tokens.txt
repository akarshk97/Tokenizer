we

based

criterion
does
the

reflect

for

reason
and
one
reason
only
to
providea
clear
picture
of
where
individualmembers
of
congress
stand
on
an
ideological
scalethus
for
example
the
1993
vote
on
nafta
was
notrated
though
it
clearly
was
one
of
the
mostimportant
votes
of
the
session
in
terms
of
legislativeimpact
the
nafta
vote
was
omittedfrom
the
1993
ratings
because
it
was
not
an
ideologicallydrivenvote
many
conservatives
votedyes
while
a
significant
number
of

no
similarly
many
liberals
