we
endeavor
to
analyze
a

from
each

it
rates
based
on
asimple
criterion
does
the
vote
reflect
a
clearideological
distinction
in
the

thus
thevotes
we
select

are
not
necessarilythose
considered
the
most

orthe
key
votes
of
any

they

we

consideration
they
arechosen
for
one
reason
and
one
reason
only
to
providea
clear
picture
of
where
individualmembers
of
congress
stand
on
an
ideological
scalethus
for
example
the
vote
on
nafta
was
notrated
though
it
clearly
was
one
of
the
mostimportant
votes
of
the
session
in
terms
of
legislativeimpact
the
nafta
vote
was
omittedfrom
the
ratings
because
it
was
not
an
ideologicallydrivenvote
many
conservatives
votedyes
while
a
significant
number
of
conservativesvoted
no
similarly
many
liberals
voted
no
buta
significant

simple
but
important
criterion
