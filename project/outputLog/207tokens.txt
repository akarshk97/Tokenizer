in

of
wfps
missionand
nonalignment
philosophy
we
were
asked
not
to
have
contactwith
her
since
she
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
she
was
underconstant
surveillance
by
agents
of
the
guatemalan
military
anyassociation
with
her
could
impugn
wfps
standing
in
guatemalaand
could
get
some
of
the
longterm
volunteers
there
on
touristvisas
kicked
out

was
working

see
for

frustrationshe
launched
a
hunger

60
minutes

the

continued
in
its
insistence
that
it
had
noknowledge
of

happened
to
her
husband
after
32
days
harbury
was
persuaded
to
end
the

knewafter
another
four
months
of
frustration
she
began
a
secondhunger

in

the
white

it
was
then
thatrep
torricelli

from
the
house
intelligence
committee
disclosedthe
fact
that
the
us
government
knew
that
her
husband
had
beentaken
alive
that
he
had
been
tortured
and
murdered
in
captivityand
that
this
atrocity
had
been
presided
over
by
a
guatemalanofficer
colonel
alpirez
who
was
being
paid
by
the
cia
alpirezwas
also
implicated
in
the
murder
of
us
citizen
michael
devine
when
we
saw
harbury
she
was
in
guatemala
to
lay
the
legalbasis
for
litigation
to
find
and
recover
her
husbands
body
something
the
military
was
opposing
at
every
turn
while
she
wasthere
on

year
her

we
asked
her
about
the
recent
attacks
perhapswe
should
have
picked
a
more
discreet
spot
apparently
the
newsof
the
attacks
had
been
blown
out
of
the
headlines
by
the
bigsnowstorm
in
the
us
still
she
saw
the
attacks
as
a
definitemessage
from
the
guatemalan
military
not
the
cia
thecias
not
stupid
to
silence
her
but
after
losing
a
husbandand
a
pregnancy
she
felt
that
she
didnt
have
anything
else
tolose
her
case
illuminates
the
need
for
a
