global
network
to
eliminate
nuclear
weaponsthe
abolition
2000
network
is
a
network
of
over
300
organisations
andgrowing
on
every
continent
working
for
the
abolition
of
nuclear
weaponsit
grew
from
many
seeds
the
world
court
project
the
internationalcoalition
for
nonproliferation
the
global
alliance
against
nuclear
armsthe
abolition
caucus
etc
all
of
these
movements
are
like
streams
that
ledinto
the
river
that
is
the
abolition
2000
network
it
is
not
a
membershipbody
but
is
open
to
all
organisations
endorsing
the
abolition
statementdrafted
at
the
npt
conference
in
new
york
in
1995
its
overarchingpremise
is
the
vision
of
entering
the
21st
century
with
a
plan
in
place
forthe
elimination
of
nuclear
weaponswhat
is
the
network300
organisations
have
organised
themselves
into
what
was
termed
atight
rather
than
the
usual
loose
network
which
aims
to
provide
groupsconcerned
with
nuclear
issues
a
forum
for
the
exchange
of
informationand
the
development
of
joint
initiatives
the
tightness
of
the
networklike
the
tautness
of
a
web
is
defined
by
how
close
the
members
of
thenetwork
work
together

how
good

at

in

a
group
of

activists
representing
ngos
fromall
around
the

met
each
day
to
coordinate
their
work
and
calledthemselves

this

drafted
a
consensusdocument
which
was
known
as
the

in
less
than
twoweeks
the
first
200
organisations
had
signed

added

that
requires

requested

in

of

the
opposition
