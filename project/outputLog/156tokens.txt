a
global
network
to
eliminate
nuclear
weaponsthe
abolition
network
is
a
network
of
over
organisations
andgrowing
on
every
continent
working
for
the
abolition
of
nuclear
weaponsit
grew
from
many
seeds
the
world
court
project
the
internationalcoalition
for
nonproliferation
the
global
alliance
against
nuclear
armsthe
abolition
caucus
etc
all
of
these
movements
are
like
streams
that
ledinto
the
river
that
is
the
abolition
network
it
is
not
a

but
is
open
to
all
organisations
endorsing
the

statementdrafted
at
the

in

is
the
vision
of

with
a
plan
in

forthe
elimination
of

is
the
network
organisations
have
organised
themselves
into
what
was
termed
atight
rather
than
the
usual
loose
network
which
aims
to
provide
groupsconcerned
with
nuclear
issues
a
forum
for
the
exchange
of
informationand
the
development
of
joint
initiatives
the
tightness
of
the

the
tautness
of
a
web
is
defined
by
how
close
the
members
of

together
