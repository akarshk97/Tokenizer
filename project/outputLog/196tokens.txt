a
low
earthorbiting
leo
receiver
wassuccessfully
launched
aboard
the
microlab
1
satellite
thisreceiver
orbiting
at
an
altitude
of
about
700
km
receives
radiosignals
from
the
constellation
of
24
global
positioning
systemgps
satellites
these
radio
signals
are
refracted
or
bent
by
theearths
atmosphere
and
by
measuring
the
doppler
shiftedfrequency
of
the
received
radio
signals
these
measurements
areconverted
into
vertical
pressure
and
temperature
profiles
of
theearths
atmosphere
early
results
indicate
that
accuracies
of
about1
to
2
k
are
being
obtained
between
altitudes
of
about
5
km
to35
km
this
new
remote
sensing
technique
promises
to
open
upnew
ways
to
monitor
climate
and
climate
change
and
also
toprovide
substantially
improved
initial
global
