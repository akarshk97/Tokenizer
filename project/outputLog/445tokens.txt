for
now
i
told
the

even
though
the

was
only
acouple
of
pounds

molloy
called
to
the
young
mans
fathers
house
intyrone
that
same
night
and
talked
with
the
british
agentsvictim
by
phone
assuring
him
that
he
had
notified
humanrights
lawyer
gareth
peirce
and
an
irishbased
lawyerfamiliar
with
similar
threats
and
approaches
molloy
hasalso
given
him
a
contact
number
in
london
where
he
can
bereached
during
molloys
visit
to
london
this
weekthis
is
a
disturbing
case
explained
molloy
over
thepast
number
of
weeks
other
victims
have
come
forward
butrequested
no
publicity
worringly
these
approaches
haveincreased
from
the
murder
of
diarmuid
oneill
on
23september
it
is
clearly
a
signal
from
mi5
and
other
covertagencies
that
they
are
intent
on
targeting
the
irishcommunity
in
england
what
other
shattered
lives
are
theyleaving
by
these
heavyhanded
oppressive
tactics
i
wouldappeal
for
anyone
caught
in
a
similar
trap
to
contact
alawyer
or
public
representative
to
document
theiractivities
not
to
