worldwide
thecase
for

becomes
more
compelling
with
each
passing

has
it
been
shown
that

any
specialpower
to

political
violence
in

it
is
used
disproportionately
against
the

and
againstracial
and
ethnic
minorities
it
is
often
used
as
a
tool
of
politicalrepression
its
use
is
arbitrary

irrevocable
it
is
imposedand
inflicted
arbitrarily
it
is
an
irrevocable
punishment
resultinginevitably
in
the
execution
of
people
innocent
of

is
a
violation
of
fundamental
human

can
justifya
punishment
as
cruel
as
death
conflicts
