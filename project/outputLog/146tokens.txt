from

census
ofemployment
the
first
data
set
at
a
local

released
on
the
basis
of
thesic
classification
this
is
a
major
reclassification
from
sic
someproblems
were
initially
evident
in
the
data
released
by
nomis
with
someinconsistencies
in
the
areas
and
these
data
were
withdrawn
and
rereleased
also
the
dualclassified
data
essential
for
understanding
the
effect
of
thechanges
at
local
level
have
only
just
been
released
and
very
interesting
theyare
toousers
of
these
data
will
know
that
the
sic
revision
has
required
a
majorreclassification
of
employment
by
the
office
of
national
statistics
ons
hasbeen
formed
from
the
merger
of
opcs
and
cso
with
overnight
some
of
ukmanufacturing
employment
being
reclassified
into
business
services
localanalysts
will
need
to
look
carefully
at
the
changes
in
their
own
local
data
setsand
in
principle
this
is
best
done
with
the
data
since
it
is
dual

is
a
fuller
data
set
census

series
are
themajor
guide
to
economic
restructuring
at
the
local
level
so
that
this
break
inthe
series
will
be
a
major
concern
to
local
practitioners
the
good
news
isthat
in
future
these
data
will
be
available
annually
from
ons
with
less
than
ayears
delay
although
based
on
a

rather
than
a

assessed
the

a

procedure
for
constructing

for
local
authorities
will
have
the
advantage
of
access
to

information
onthe
reclassification
of
their
local
firms
and
we
are
happy
to
work
with
