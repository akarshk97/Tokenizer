here
mahony
notes

theres
anything

says
mahonywith
the
number
of
partners
involved
it
will
not
be
surprisingif
problems
arise
along
the
way
theres
bound
to
besome
conflict
as
the
two
philosophies
integrate

its
not
going
to
be

sailing
all
the
waybut
with

looking

to

mahony
says
the
reception
from
everyone
has
been
verypositivea
number
of

elainestevens
a
herbalist
serving
on
the
committee
says
she
is
justtrying
to
be
a
voice
for
the
herbal
community
the
idea
of
the
tzu
chi
is
to
try
to
make
the
best
use
ofalternative
and
complementary
techniques
she
says
thehealth
of
the
patient
is
the
most
important
thing
were
lookingat
even
with
a
common
interest
and
concern
for
the

steven
concedes
that
it
is
going
to
take
time
to
geteveryone
on
the
same
page
as
long
as
everyone
works
togetherthis
will
be
a
tremendously
successful
idea
she
saysfrom
a
personal
perspective
stevens
says
the
development
of
theinstitute
indicates
there
is
an
understanding
that
a
tremendousamount
of
work
can
be
done
before
people
need
hospitalizationor
acute
care
we
should
be
looking
at
other
ways
of
treatingpeople
but
she
says
i
dont
see
this
as
thehospital
trying
to
pass
or
fail
various
types
of
treatmentinstead
the
institute
may
help
set
standards
and
protocols
foreveryone
involved
in
healthwith
the
exploding
growth
of
interest
in
alternative
medicinescorrect
information
is
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
the
fullbenefit
of
their
potential
one
of
the
biggest
dangers
ispeople
selfmedicating
stevens
says
you
dontwant
to
be
taking
things
that
will
work
in
an
adversarial
wayand
education
shouldnt
be
limited
to
patients
either
ifdoctors
include
herbs
in
their
practice
they
need
greater
educationto

daniel
cheng
seesthe
institute
serving
many
purposes
research
can
determine
thevalidity
of
some
of
the
alternative
methods
and
testing
can
helpin
other
ways
as
well
this
can
be
more
convincing
and
helpprotect
the
consumers
rights
cheng
says
if
somemethods
prove
successful
during
testing
it
may
eventually
leadto
cheaper
health
care
for
everyone
as
the
health
of
the
generalpopulation
improves
he
addswhile
there
may
have
been
skepticism
voiced
by
the
medical
communityin
the
past
cheng
says
he
believes
that
has
changed
inthe
beginning
they
laughed
at
me
he
says
the
majoritynow
agree
with
what
were
trying
to
do
he
says
themedical
field
is
more
openminded
now
and
doctors
are
tryingtheir
best
to
help
with
the
programthe
institute
will
require
support
from
other
areas
to
make
ita
success
research
is
very
expensive
we
will
have
to
seehow
this
can
be
done
he
cautions
we
need
a
lot
ofsupport
from
the
