both

is
unfavorable
for
the
occurrence
of

despite
theabundance
of

during

this
is
because
that

an

in

as

one
of
the

that

this

that

only
one

the
strong

suggests
that
large
surface
pressure
gradient
associated
with
a
verystrong

anticyclone
and
abundant

of

is
an
importantdriving

this

alsosuggests
that
the

may
be
related
to
theoccurrence
of

two
stratifications
of
cold
surges
are
revealing
when
consideringthe
relationship
between
enso
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
coldair
activity
the
first
stratification
as
described
in
the
cold

criteria
yields
result
that
is
consistent
with
the
in

from

the
interannual
variation
of

frequencyshows
that
minimum
surge
frequency
occurs
one
year
after
an
el
nino
eventthe
second
stratification
based
on
the
maximum
meridional
wind
event
inthe
south
china
sea
indicates
that
the
interannual

of
the

is
in
good
agreement

during

low

isassociated
with

the
variation
of
the

meridional

near

south
china
sea
andtge
narutune
hinges
on
the
south
china
sea
cold
surges
as
in
the
caseof
the
cold

the
interannual
variation
of
the
wind
is
also
wellcorrelated
with
the
soi
strong

years
are
associated
with
la
ninaand
high

events
weak
wind
years
are
found
during
el

low

this
pattern
of
variation
is
restricted
north
of
the
equator
withinnnee
and
confined
to
the
near
surfacelayer
the
interannual
variation
of
the
siberian
high
measured
by
meansof
both
pressure
and
wind
is
in
general
agreement
with
the
soi
both
thestrength
of
the

jetstream
and
the
hpa
trough
are
found
to
beweaker
than

during

although
their
interannual

do
not
agree
with
the
soi
as
closely
as
that
of
the
siberian
highgiven
the
close
relationship
between
the
soi
and
the
interannual
variationof
the
monsoon
meridional
wind
and
cold
surges
it
is
natural
to
wonderwhy
some
of
the
monsoon
related
disturbances
either
originated
from
orlocated
in
the
extratropics
exhibit
variation
patterns
similar
to
thesoi
and
what
are
the
physical
mechanisms
between
the
ensowinter
monsooninteraction
during
a
typical
el
nino
year
the
convective
activity
in
the
maritimecontinent
is
usually
reduced
if
the
cumulus
convection
in
this
regionis
one
of
the
most
important
monsoon
energy
sources
as
suggested
by
ramage
the
suppression
of
the
maritime
convection
should
be
responsibleat
least
partly
for
the
weaker
than
normal
extratropical
monsoon
circulationduring
el
nino
events
with
the
available
observed
outgoing
longwave
radiationolr
data
from
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
wehave
computed
the
olr

in
the
maritime
continent
eens
from
the
overall
interannual

patternnot
shown
here
is
not
as
close
to
the
soi
as
that
of
the
south
chinasea
cold

or
the
siberian

however
negative

is
foundduring
the
la
nina
season
likewise
positive
olr
anomalies
arefound
during
the

el
nino
seasons
the
correlation
coefficientbetween
the
olr
anomaly
and
the
soi
is
ron
the
other
hand
evidence
indicated
that
the
winter
monsoon
and
coldair
activity
can
greatly
affect
the
tropical
convective
activity
and
sstslingo
personal
communication
found
that
indonesian
convectionis
enhanced
when
cold
surges
penetrated
far
into
the
tropics
chang
etal
have
shown
that
cold
surges
are
capable
of
influencing
the
tropicalsst
but
whether
the
cold
surges
can
significantly
affect
the
tropicalregion
as
has
been
discussed
depends
on
the
intensity
and
path
of
thecold
surges
it
may
also
relate
to
the
background
largescale
circulationtheoretical
studies
have
suggested
branstator
lau
and
lim
that
the
interaction
between
the
tropical
convection
and
midlatitude
circulationdepends
critically
on
the
relative
position
of
the
convection
and
extratropicalquasistationary
waves
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
the
interactionbetween
cold
surges
and
convective
activities
near
the
maritime
continentwill
in
turn
modify
the
extratropical
and
tropical
synoptic
and
planetaryscale
circulations
chang
and
lau
apparently
further
studies
aremuch
needed
to
delineate
the
mechanism
of
the
interaction
between
