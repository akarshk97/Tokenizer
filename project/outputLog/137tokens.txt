both

is
unfavorable
for
the
occurrence

despite
theabundance

this
is
because

a

only

the

suggests
that
large
surface

gradient
associated

anticyclone
and
abundant

of

an
importantdriving

this

alsosuggests
that
the

be
related
to
theoccurrence
of

summary
and
discussionthe
study
of
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
from
the19791995
ncepncar
reanalyses
has
revealed
and
extended
several
noteworthyclimatological
features
of
the
winter
monsoon
according
to
the
conventionalcold
surge
criteria
about
13
cold
surges
occur
every
winter
season
ofwhich
two
are
strong
cases
that
influence
the
tropical
region
the
averagelifetime
of
the
cold
surges
is
about
7
days
and
the
average
intensity
ofhighs
is
1053
hpa
the
strong
cases
usually
last
for
about
9
days
withaverage
intensity
of
1060
hpathe
cold
surges
tend
to
originate
from
two
source
regions
one
is
nearthe
northwest
of
lake
baikal
and
the
other
is
to
the
north
of
lake
balkhashthe
high

centers
propagate
southeastward
and
end
in
the
eastand
southeast
of
china
and
surrounding
oceans
consistent
with
trajectoriesof

centers
correlation
patterns
indicate
that
the
signature
ofassociated
slp
surface
wind
and
surface
air
temperature
stretches
furthersouth
and
east
the
southward
extent
includes
the
bulk
of
the
maritimecontinent
the
eastward
extent
reaches
150e
although
the
intensity
of
the
siberian
high
varies
according
to
theseason
and
reaches
its
peak
in
january
the
cold
surges
are
most
activeduring
november
and
marchthis
result
suggests
that
november
through
marchshould
be
considered
as
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
season
it
also
indicatesthat
the
occurrence
of
cold
surges
does
not
monotonically
increase
withthe
strengthening
of
the
siberian
high
an
empirical
rule
that
has
beenwidely
believed
in
the
forecasting
community
examination
of
monthly
distributionof
strong
cold
surges
indicates
however
that
the
majority
of
strong
coldsurges
occurs
during
djf
this
result
suggests
that
large
pressure
gradientassociated
with
strong
siberian
high
is
an
important
driving
force
to
pushthe
cold
air
far
into
the
tropicsthe
two
stratifications
of
cold
surges
are
revealing
when
consideringthe
relationship
between
enso
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
coldair
activity
the
first
stratification
as
described
in
the
cold

criteria
yields
result
that
is
consistent
with
the
in

the

that

one
year
after
an

nino

second
stratification
based
on
the
maximum

inthe

indicates
that

the

with

it
is
natural
to
wonderwhy
some
of
the
monsoon
related
disturbances
either
originated
from

in
the
extratropics
exhibit
variation
patterns
similar
to
thesoi

what
are
the
physical
mechanisms
between

during
a
typical

the
convective

in

is
usually
reduced
if
the
cumulus
convection
in
this
regionis
one
of
the
most
important
monsoon
energy
sources
as
suggested
by
ramage1971
the
suppression
of
the
maritime

should
be
responsibleat

partly
for
the
weaker

the

shown
that

are
capable
of
influencing
the
tropicalsst
but
whether
the
cold

can
significantly
affect
the

as
has
been
discussed
depends
on
the
intensity

path
of
thecold

it
may
also
relate
to

largescale

have
suggested
branstator

lau
and
lim
1984that
the
interaction
between
the

and

circulationdepends
critically
on
the
relative
position
of

and
extratropicalquasistationary

it
has
also
been
suggested
that
the
interactionbetween
cold

activities
near
the

continentwill
in
turn
modify
the
extratropical
