hopesto
offer
observations
on
critical
factors
which
have
lead
to
thedramatic
growth
of
the
internet
unique
characteristics
whichmake
the
internet
a
rich
forum
for
democratic
discourse
and
lessonsfor
the
future
that
we
can
take
from
these
developments
the
internet
has
shown
that
both
choice
of
architecture
and
costof
service
are
essential
to
providing
widespread
access
to
a
diversityof
information
the
internet
manifests
five
critical
attributesin
its
basic
architecture
that
give
it

we
hope
that
the
commission
willtake
these
characteristics
as
baseline
policy
goals
the
democraticpotential
of
the
internet
will
only
be
realized
with
broad
accessto
the

for
both
individuals
and
community
organizations
thecommission
can
help
bring
that
potential
of
the
internet
to
thebroad
crosssection
of
the
population
by
encouraging
the
developmentof
new
access
options
that
promote
these
essential
attributesof
the

architectureii
open
decentralized
architecturethe
strength
of
the
internet
derives
from
both
affordable
accessand
a
uniquely
open
architecture
traditional
communications
mediasuch
as
radio
and
television
have
been
affordable
and
readilyavailable
around
the
country
but
have
failed
to
enable
full
democraticbecause
of
architectural
limitations
for
example
online
discussionsof
political
issues
enable
users
to
exchange
views
and
even
posequestions
to
political
figures
in
a
way
that
broadcast
televisioncan
never
support
the
internets
architecture
allows
for
a
diversityof
views
and
exchange
of
information
which
are
simply
impossiblein
any
other
communications
medium
decentralized

infrastructurethe
internet
supports
such
a
great
diversity
of
opinion
ideasand
information
because
it
is
a
decentralized
networka
user
can
create
a
new
web
site
or
participate
in
a
usenet
newsgroupwithout
obtaining
permission
in

from
any
central
authorityfor
example
to
create
a
web
page
that
will
be
publicly
accessibleto
millions
of
internet
users
around
the
world
one
need
onlyfind
a

and
often
pay

the
decentralizedarchitecture
of
the

has
guaranteed
that
there

unlike
traditionalbroadcast

the
internet
has
no
central

anyonewith

can
do
so
from
anypoint

important
the
resources
needed
to
establish
a
new
webpage
or
post
a
new

are
essentially
unlimited
adding

page
or
a

posting
does
not
require
that
anothersite
or

be
eliminated
from
the

in
fact
the
marginalcost
of
the
last
web
page
added
to
the
net
is
equal
to
or
lessthan
the
cost
of
the
first

this
is
an
environment
characterizedby
an
abundance
of
communications
opportunitiesthis
abundance
stands
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
scarcity
of

which
has
been
such
a
prominent
feature
for

the
broadcast

cable
television
media
broadcasting

requires
that
one
compete
for

pay
a
high
price
for
a

slot
under
the
controlof
the
broadcaster
or

operator
the
high
demand
for

traditional

has
raised
their

far
beyond

today
many
people
think
of
andexperience
the

as
primarily
the
world
wide
web
yettwo
or
three
years
ago
the
web
was
little
more
than
an
experimentalservice
being
developed
in
a
physics
laboratory
in
switzerlandthis
years
world
wide

is
vastly
different

easy

it
was

addressing
protocols
are
evolvingin
order
to
meeting
increasing
usage
levels
around
the
worldthese
and
other
technical
advances
have
been
possible
becauseof
the
open
public
standards
on
which
the
internet
is
builtin
this
open

new
technologies
can
be
developed
anddeployed
by
various
members
of

are
adopted
by

as
a

whileothers

not
this
development
process
however
can
proceedrelatively
easily
because
the
basic
internet
standards
are
publicand
available
as
building
blocks
for
new
developments
affordable
accessthe
internets
architecture
is
what
makes
it
unique
but
it
wouldbe
of
no
use
if
access
were
too
expensive
for
users
there
aregood
reasons
to
believe
that
information
on
the
internet
willbe
inherently
more
affordable
than
other
media
however
as
multimediaand
other
highbandwidth
applications
become
more
popular
theability

voicecall
oriented

maintain
affordable
access
to

will
be
called
into
questionthree
separate
cost
elements
ought
to
be
distinguished
in
thisdiscussion
the
cost
of
a
personal
computer

the

of

and
thecost
of
the
underlying
telecommunications
service
which

or

hardware
costs
remainsubstantial
but
new
developments
in

that

in

higherbandwidth
methods
of

tothe

question
of

is
raised
most
directly
in

we
commend
the
commission
for
beginning
this
inquiry
intothe
question
of
how
to
promote
the
availability
of

the
challenge
facing
the
commission
and
other
policymakers
going
forward
is
to
enable
users
to
have

affordable
digital

options
in
a
manner
thatis
consistent
with
the
fundamental
architectural
characteristicsthat
have
made
the

such
an
important
new
medium
highbandwidth
service
is
needed
but
is
only
useful
where
it
maintainsthe
open

that
has

grow
to
serve
democratic
valuesachieving
all
these
goals
in
the

occurringthroughout
the
telecommunications
market
will
indeed
be
a
challengecdt

not
come
to
this

with

rather
a
hope
that
the

activities
can
be
guidedby
the
stunning
success
already
manifest
in
the
