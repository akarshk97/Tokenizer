this

the

perhaps
the

the

continued

isneeded
to
help

the

one
approach
is
using

provide

to

another
promising
approach
iscombining

toinfer

deciding
the

and
the

one
has
to
take
into
account
the
natural
spatialvariability
of

thus
when
estimating
the
accuracy
of
atechnique
estimated
and
in

measured

are
typically

inthis
way
areal
averages
from
the

are

and
the
natural

in
the

quantity
becomes
a

thecurrent

the

there

it

that

it
